# Ascii Factory
A C++ remake of my factory game prototype I originally made in Rust with Bevy. This version uses EnTT for the ECS and libtcod for text graphics.

# Credits
This project is built off of the template project for libtcod. EnTT is used for the ECS, and FastNoise2 is used for noise generation.
